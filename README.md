# Assembly Line Project

## Project Overview

The Assembly Line Project is a term project that provides an opportunity to apply C++ Object-Oriented skills by simulating an assembly line with any number of stations. The project illustrates a line with three stations, and its purpose is to manage customer orders efficiently through the assembly process.

In this solution, the assembly line consists of a series of workstations, each holding a set of stock items specific to the station. A line manager navigates customer orders along the line, filling orders at each station based on the items requested. Each customer order comprises a list of items to be filled, and each station processes a queue of orders.

## Key Features

- **Station Workflows:** Each station processes a queue of orders by filling the next order if it requests the station's item and the item is in stock.

- **Line Manager:** The line manager moves customer orders from station to station until all orders have been processed.

- **Inventory Tracking:** Stations keep track of inventory, and orders are completed or marked incomplete based on the availability of items.

## Getting Started

To run the Assembly Line Project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   * Link: git clone https://github.com/adnan-mohammed7/Assembly-Line-Project.git
     
2. Build and run the project using your preferred C++ compiler.

3. Follow on-screen instructions for simulating the assembly line.

Simulation Output
At the end of the simulation, the system will list completed orders and those that are incomplete due to a lack of inventory at one or more stations.
